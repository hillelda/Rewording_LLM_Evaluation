Advanced NLP project 67664 Beyond the Surface:  Rewording as a Lens for Robust LLM Evaluation

## The Code has two parts
### Generating an answer to a multi-choice question (as structured in the MMLU database)
This code has the following parts:
1. Loading the model and tokenizer
2. Definitions of functions for generating responses:
  a. create_prompt - gets the question and possible answers and created a prompt to answer the question with the choices
  b. generate_response - using model generate with a prompt to answer
3. Uploading the dataset with google colab's ui
4. Applying the generate response to the create prompt on each row in the dataframe
5. Function to check correctness in the data frame
6. Adding a column of correctness to the dataframe
7. Outputing the results to a new csv file. 
### Generating Llama Rephrases
This code has the generate_response function redefined to allow generating a longer response.
1. generate_new_prompt is a function that takes question answers and id and creates a prompt to rephrase the question and each of the answers by the given id.
2. get_generations - applys generate_response on the prompts generated by generate_new_prompt and adds the responses to the dataframes
Running the get_generations function and outputing it to the csv file.

## Generating Claude Rephrases
The claude rephrases were generated by manually prompting Claude to rephrase the question and answers.
The code used for rephrases is documented in the paper.

```
You are given the following multi-choice
question:
Which statement best explains the purpose

Please rephrase answer 0 to 50-220 chars.
Please rephrase answer 1 to 50-220 chars.
Please rephrase answer 2 to 50-220 chars.
Please rephrase answer 3 to 50-220 chars.
